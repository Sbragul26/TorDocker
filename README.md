# DarkDock

Host a website securely and privately on the Dark Web using Docker and Tor. This project sets up a Tor Onion Service that makes your site accessible via a `.onion` address while protecting your privacy.

## About

This project allows you to host a website on the Dark Web using a Docker container connected to the Tor network. It supports multiple architectures (x86_64 and ARM) and provides a simple way to run a private, anonymous Onion Service.

## Security Recommendations for Dark Web Access

Accessing the Dark Web safely requires some important precautions. Follow these best practices to protect your privacy and security:

- **Use a VPN:**  
  Connect to a trusted VPN before launching the Tor Browser. This adds an extra layer of anonymity by hiding your IP address from your ISP.

- **Use the Official Tor Browser:**  
  Access `.onion` sites only through the Tor Browser to prevent identity leaks and tracking.

- **Secure Your Server Ports:**  
  If hosting a Tor Onion Service, restrict your serverâ€™s open ports using a firewall like UFW. Only allow essential ports (e.g., SSH) and never expose Onion Service ports directly to the internet.

  ```bash
  sudo ufw default deny incoming
  sudo ufw default allow outgoing
  sudo ufw allow 22/tcp       # SSH access
  sudo ufw enable

### ðŸ›¡ Note on Docker Security

When using **DarkDock**, many of the above security concerns are **already mitigated by Docker**:

- **Tor and nginx** run inside an isolated container, reducing exposure to your host system and limiting the attack surface.  
- **Hidden service ports** are never bound to the public network interface; all external access goes through the Tor network.  
- **`.onion` service keys and hostname files** remain inside the containerâ€™s private filesystem unless you intentionally mount them to the host.  
- **Containerized environment** ensures any compromise is sandboxed and easier to isolate or rebuild.
